        <h1> Element with class selector</h1>
        <p> In this case, we can do it as follow in the declaration: p.myclass = {}.
            No space between the first and second selector. In this case, it means that this 
            style will only be applied to the "p" selector with specifies "myclass" </p>
        <p class="myclass"> this is an example as this paragraph has the style of "myclass" but previous do not.</p>
        
        <h1> Child selector </h1>
        <p> In this case, we define the style of a selector that is a child of other selectors. The 
            syntax used is as follows: parent &gt; child {} (i.e. article &gt; p {} - every p that is a direct child of article); 
        </p> 
        <article> 
            <p> This is an example of child selector. This paragraph is a direct child of an article selector.</p>
            <div> <p> This paragraph is NOT a direct child but subchild. </p></div>
        </article>
        <p> However, this paragraph is not a child and that is why its style is not affected. </p>

        <h1> Descendent selector </h1>
        <p> This is how we apply to any child, independently wether it is a direct child or not. The syntax is as follows: 
            parent&nbsp;child {} (i.e. article&nbsp;p {} - every p that is a descendent child of article)
        </p>
        <article> 
            <p> Child selector is applied to this paragraph. </p>
            <div> <span> Descendent selector is applied to this "span". </span></div>
        </article>
        <span> However, this "span" is not a child of article and style is not applied. </span>

        <h1> Not limited to element selectors </h1>
        <p> There is also a way that this is not limited to a particular selector. Examples of it are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><div> .myclass p {} (every "p" that is inside (at any level) an element with class ="myclass")</div></li>
            <li><div> article &gt; .myclass {} (every "element" with class="myclass" that is a direct child of article element</div></li> 
        </ul>    
    </body>
